JACPPH

This is Sasha.  She likes naps, cookies, pretzels, anything that drops on the floor, and anything that can be knocked onto the floor.
She doesn't know how to drink out of her water bowl - she digs in it until all the water is on the floor.
She doesn't code very well, but is passable at button-mashing.
